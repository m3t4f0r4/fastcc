## About fastcc

Have you ever compiled the linux kernel source? a lot of time huh?

It wont happen anymore! I present you...fastcc, a new-generation technology to compile C source as fast as possible.

Our record is compiling the linux kernel source in 0.2 seconds. That's awesome right?

## Installation // Usage

Just use `make` to compile it, then:

`./fastcc <in source> -o <out file>`

Try out the source files at `examples/` !!!

## How does it work?

fastcc uses secret technology stolen from the CIA (shout out to Julian Assange for sharing it) to compile C source code.

Also the final ELF is reduced in size to make it even faster at load time.

## What more does fastcc for me?

It optimizes your code!!

I compiled hashcat with fastcc...result?

Cracked 16-byte length passwords within seconds dude!

## Contact

If you want support for Windows PE file compilation then shut up!

I won't allow fastcc-optimized code to be incapsulated into that shitty PE format.

But if you want more features for ELF, then feel free to open an issue or pull requests.

Enjoy dude!
